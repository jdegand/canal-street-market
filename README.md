## Overview

![screenshot](screenshot.png)


- I don't like that the real website has a line break on the address.  There is also a picture that blends in with the background and that could have used a box-shadow or a picture replacement. The vertical panels are a striking design choice.  Having menu items pop up on hover doesn't really help convert sales or convey info to the customer. It's different just to be different.  It was unclear that they could be clicked on because of the hover as well. 'Interested in becoming a vendor?' is a weak, generic call to action.  Getting people to click that button is very important and the button should be black at all times to stand out.  Real site seems to use javascript to create panel content on load / click.  Real site uses GSAP. GSAP doesn't really seem necessary.
